  2.  2. Using the Branch; Make Changes, Stage Changes, Commit Changes, Push Changes to Remote.
  3. Merging Branches; Switch to the Target Branch, Merge the Branch, Resolve Merge Conflicts (if any), Push Merged Changes.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
  Forking a repository on GitHub is a powerful feature that allows you to create your own copy of an existing repository. This concept is particularly valuable in open-source projects and collaborative development. Here’s a detailed explanation of forking and its implications. 
  Forking
  Forking creates a personal copy of an entire repository under your GitHub account. This copy is a distinct repository that remains connected to the original repository but 
  operates independently.
  Purpose:
  Modification and Experimentation: Allows you to make changes to the project independently of the original repository. Ideal for customizing a project, experimenting with   
  new features, or contributing to open-source projects.
  Contribution: Facilitates proposing changes back to the original repository through pull requests.
  Cloning
  Cloning creates a local copy of a repository on your own computer. This copy is a full-fledged Git repository that mirrors the remote repository but is used locally.
  Local Development: Allows you to work on a repository on your local machine. Useful for development, testing, and making changes offline before pushing updates back to the 
  remote repository.
  Some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful; 1. Contributing to Open Source Projects, 2. Experimenting with New Features, 3. Customizing Projects for Specific Use Cases, 4. Learning and Practice, 5. Managing Multiple Versions, 6. Collaborating on a Project, 7. Prototyping and Proof of Concept, 8. Bug Fixes and Patches, 9. Maintaining Legacy Versions, 10. Personal Projects Based on Existing Code.
